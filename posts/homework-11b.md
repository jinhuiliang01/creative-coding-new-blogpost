# Communities of Practice

My music visualisation app is a compelling example of how digital tools can facilitate and connect multiple communities of practice within the music ecosystem. The field encompasses digital music creation, live looping, and interactive audiovisual art, connecting diverse communities of bedroom producers, live coders, electronic musicians, and music educators who share an interest in accessible music technology and browser-based creativity. The app's repertoire includes technical know-how such as HTML5 Audio implementations and musical concepts borrowed from professional DAWs such as Ableton Live, such as loop-based composition, quantised time and keyboard mapping conventions. It also covers shared troubleshooting practices for audio latency and browser compatibility issues that are common challenges in web-based music applications.
The values embedded in the application reflect the music community's commitment to democratising music making, with an emphasis on accessibility through a simple keyboard interface, instant gratification through instant sound feedback, and creative freedom from the ‘rules’ of music. These values align with the wider community's belief in learning through experimentation, process over product, and lowering barriers to musical participation. Perhaps most importantly, the app can act as a powerful broker between traditionally independent communities of practice. It transforms programming concepts into musical concepts, enabling non-programmers to program audio while introducing musicians to interactive technologies. The audio-visual connection through 3D visualisation helps to link different learning styles, while the loop-based format encourages the sharing and remixing culture prevalent in online music communities. By existing at the intersection of web development, music production, and educational technology, the application facilitates knowledge transfer and creates pathways for individuals to move and participate across multiple related communities of practice.

# Mycelial Creativity

My Music Visualisation application perfectly embodies the principles of Mycelial Creativity through its design and functionality. The holistic growth is reflected in how musical creativity can emerge from any input - users can start with piano notes, drums, or any combination, and the system can respond to creative impulses from multiple directions simultaneously and fluidly. The modular structure of the code mirrors the mycelial network, allowing different musical elements to connect and interact organically, creating new and emerging works that were not predefined by the original programmers.
Cumulative growth is embodied in the recording and looping functions, where each musical gesture builds on the previous one, creating complex layers over time. Just as mycelium absorbs nutrients and grows stronger, the application captures and preserves moments of creativity, compounding them into richer musical textures. This accumulation is enhanced by a visual feedback system - each note played leaves a trail of movement on the screen, creating a visible record of the creative process, which together builds a visual sound ecosystem.
Transformational growth is achieved through the application's ability to transform simple keyboard input into a complex audiovisual experience. The 3D spheres morph and react to the musical input, creating new aesthetic possibilities beyond the original material. More importantly, the looping mechanism transforms linear musical explorations into looping, ever-evolving compositions with unexpected juxtapositions and rhythmic relationships that can even surprise their creators.
Sub-entities emerge as users create complete loops that can be shared, performed, or inspired by others. These completed musical loops represent the visible, shareable fruits of the underlying creative network - like mushrooms emerging from a hidden web of mycelium. The application facilitates the transition from intangible creative exploration to tangible artistic expression, exemplifying how mycelial creativity can move from underground network activity to surface manifestation, creating works that can seed new creative networks among other users and communities.
