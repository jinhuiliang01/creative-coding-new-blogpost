1. A description of what live coding is.

Live coding is kinda like a performance to perform audio and visual through coding way and audience could see how the performer could set up all the things step by step. I think this kind of performance is more focus on the process but not the result. When coders coding, every steps would make different changes affecting the output. And sometimes it would be a syntax error lead to the performance interruption. As for the coders, I think it could be a group work or a individual work. But as for group work, it would be harder becuase coders would never know what did the other people did and maybe it would lead to an error.

2. The differences between live coding and other forms of music performance for:
   the audience, the performer.

For the audience:

Live coding is more focus on progress that audience could see how to make and set up the whole music step by step. But other forms of music performance like live show or concert they are more focus on the result. That means audience could only know what is the comeup of band, stage, light etc.. Also in the progress, audience could see the bugs and debugs when coders are coding but in live show they would take this as an accident but not part of the show. As for the audience feeling, live coding music is all generated by computer so it would be so electric but for other forms of music performances it could be live performance of musical instrument, and it would be less fake, and it feels better live.

For the performer:

Live coding would be more chill because audience would take the accident coders made as part of the performance but in other forms audience would take the bugs in the stage as a mistake. As for the skills, live coding need to know some knowledge both in coding and music way, but for other forms, maybe just only need to know about how to play music well in live. As for the tools, live coding only need to bring a computer, code editor. Other forms need physical instruments or DJ gear. As for the mindset, there's an acceptance of improvisation in live coding but other forms is a prior thing. They need to prepare sufficiently.

3. An account of your own experience doing live coding, with reference to both:
   aspects that you found frustrating and aspects that you found rewarding.

When I'm doing live coding, I found so hard to do a freestyle becuase it always showing syntax error and sometimes becuase of the high pressure I cannot find where is the bug. And the most frustrating thing is that I try to do a note thing in strudel, it is worked when I'm practising but when I recording it is not worked and I cannot figure it out why. And also when I wanna do notes with drums it is only playing one track and I don't know how to play tracks together at the same time. So the next time recording I only use drum sets and it work perfectly and I found it rewarding.

# Discuss about the live coding community of practice.

1. Some links to live coding content that you find interesting, and why.

I find it interesting because it is like a DJ gear and she's so good because there's no interruption because of her mistake when she's coding. I think this is hard to do in live coding. At the same time, she uses the wave pattern instead of the visual thing like hydra which she could more focus on her coding of the music.

This is typically a group work and it is interesting because now I could see the visual and listen to the audio at the same time. And their coorporation works really well. And the connection between the updated codes are pretty well too.

2. A description of this community's domain, repertoire, and values.
   Domain:

The community focuses on live coding as both art and technical practice.
Writing code live to generate music, visuals, or interactive installations.
Public demonstrations where the act of coding becomes part of the artistic experience.

Repertoire:

Algoraves: Live-coded electronic music performances.
Screen-sharing and live streaming: Transparency in process.
Tools and languages: strudel, hydra etc..

Value:

Code transparency (sharing scripts during performances), embracing glitches, bugs, and improvisation as artistic elements, valuing process over product.

3. Some discussion regarding the relation (if any) between cultural performance practices (music, theatre, art, etc.) and: young people's intrinsic motivations for learning, education systems & pedagogy, discourse / public debate, more broadly, legislation

Young people's intrinsic motivations for learning:
Cultural performance practices engage young people’s intrinsic motivations by tapping into creativity, self-expression, and identity formation. Performance arts encourage risk-taking in a low-stakes environment, fostering curiosity and resilience. Overemphasis on extrinsic rewards (e.g., grades, competitions) in formal arts education can undermine intrinsic joy. Grassroots collectives often counter this by prioritizing process over product.

Education systems & pedagogy:
Performance practices challenge traditional pedagogies and inspire alternative educational models: Schools incorporating theatre, music, or digital arts improved engagement and critical thinking.

Discourse / public debate, more broadly:
Performance shapes and reflects societal narratives, influencing debates on identity, power, and technology: Plays, protest music, and street art (e.g., climate activism through performance) amplify marginalized voices and critique systemic issues. For example, Hamilton reshaped public dialogue on immigration and history. Live coding performances spark debates about AI’s role in art, while digital privacy concerns emerge in immersive theatre using biometric data.

Legislation:
Governments and institutions regulate, fund, or suppress performance practices, reflecting broader ideological battles: Laws restricting “political” art (e.g., Russia’s anti-LGBTQ+ legislation) directly impact performance freedoms. Conversely, UNESCO’s 2005 Convention on Cultural Diversity protects artistic expression as a human right. Mandates for arts education (e.g., Finland’s national curriculum) correlate with higher student well-being, while their absence exacerbates inequity. Laws struggle to adapt to remix culture and AI-generated art, affecting young creators who blend sampling, code, and performance.
