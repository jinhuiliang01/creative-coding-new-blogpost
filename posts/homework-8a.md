# Document my trials and tribulations on my blog.

In the process of upgrading my blog, there was no problem in creating a new repository first. The problem occurred when I modify the index.tsx file to be a landing page I opened the index.tsx file and found a lot of red lines inside indicating error. I don't know how to deal with it.

# List 5 communities of practice (CoPs) you are a member of. List the domain, repertoire, and values of each CoP.

5 communities of practice I am a member of:

1. Guitar CoP: We communicate acoustic and electric guitar and help each other to play better. Like sometimes playing standing up is different from sitting down, everyone shares their favourite way and how to help the other way to get used to the other way. Also, because there are so many different kinds of guitar tablature, not everyone can read all the pentatonic, hexatonic, and chord tablature. Some people are good at power chords, some people are good at solos.

2. Music CoP: The difference between guitar CoP and guitar CoP is that guitar CoP is only about guitar technique, but music CoP involves music theory knowledge, and we will exchange ideas about arranging and composing music. We will exchange ideas about arranging and composing music, because we want to make a good piece of music, and we need a good melody, so we can exchange ideas with each other in the community and receive professional advice to make better music.

3. Intangible Cultural Heritage of China CoP: We will exchange views on the promotion of Chinese intangible cultural heritage to find better ways to promote outstanding Chinese culture to the outside world. At present, we are promoting it domestically, but at the same time, we are also looking for ways to promote it abroad. In the community, there are ICH inheritors, students, teachers, professors, all of whom come together in a community for the purpose of promoting culture. We are trying to come up with a new, modern way for people to get in touch with and accept traditional Chinese culture.

4. Painting CoP: In the painting community we have different types of expertise, some people are good at oil paintings and some people are good at sketches, so in fact, in the community we will send out our work and seek advice on how to modify our paintings. Especially some of the Chinese college entrance exam art students who are going to take the art exam will also send their usual practice paintings to the community to give each other advice to help him improve.

5. Cooking CoP: This community will focus on a variety of dishes, in addition to the nine major Chinese cuisines, but also includes foreign cuisines, and then we will post the recipe ah ingredients ah, we can learn from each other to other countries or other varieties of dishes, can also be achieved at home to go out to the restaurant to eat the same effect.

# List the domain, repertoire, and values of creative coding.

Domain: The shared focus of creative coding is the intersection of code, art and technology, the goal is to create expressive, interactive or generated digital art. Challenge the traditional boundaries between art, design and technology.

Repertoire: Shared tools, techniques and practices within the community. Techniques and output is the Algorithmic art, Real-time interactivity, data-driven art. Tools and languages are like Javascript, GLSL (shaders).

Values: Prioritizing low-barrier entry for non-coders and democratizing technology like p5.js this kind of open sources tool. Also it is valuing process over product, encouraging risk-taking and unconventional approaches to achieve their goals. It could bridge artists, engineers, designers and scientists. It rejects gatekeeping in both art and coding spaces. Let people could study code in a interesting way.

# Brainstorm some ideas for my AT3 refer to the communities listed above.

As for AT 3 I need to reflect on the work of Lauren Lee McCarthy 'I Heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS'. This is a multidisciplinary art project that interrogates the tension between pandemic era safety protocols and the human need for communication. The work critiques the paradox of proximity during the pandemic: being physically near yet emotionally distant due to safety mandates. The monologue challenges the nation that mask and six-foot distancing are sufficient, escalating to the idea that talking itself is dangerous.
As for the artistic intent, perhaps she's thinking can technology truly bridge isolation, or does it deepen disconnectiion? What happens when even talking, a fundamental human act is framed as a threat.

So I have some basic concept idea of my AT 3.
Inspired by the idea that verbal communication is 'dangerous', a digital sound environment was created where users could communicate through music and ambient sound rather thantalking. Like mushrooms in a mycelial network quietly and collectivel transmitting messages underground. This becomes an online community of practice, where users don't talk to each other, but contribute sounds to each other, resulting in a shared, adaptive musical environment.

This is base on web. On entering, a user hears the current soundscape (contributes by previous users). Users are invited to add a small element - a beat, a drone, a melody by pressing a key. Visualize the 'mycelium' of sound - threads branch and thicken where there's some user interaction. It shows a soft glowing web that pulses or reacts with each new sound added. Sound nodes represent previous user's contributions - hovering or clicking can let users hear individual messages.
