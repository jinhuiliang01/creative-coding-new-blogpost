# Document the process in this blog post with some discussion.

I used TouchDesigner to make a small animation. The reason I chose TouchDesigner is very simple, mainly because the two guests invited to the class used Touch Designer as the main supporting material to help them realise their projects. Therefore, it's a lot easier to get started with the two guests as examples. Plus in today's class, Minnie taught me step by step how to get started. After the lesson and watching the YouTube Tutorials, I basically learnt the basic logic and basic practice, so I made a wave.

In my personal practice, I can learn from Minnie and start with some simple animation, then after I get the hang of it, I can try to combine audio and video, and then I can add interactive content.

In my opinion, the advantage of this GPL is that it can do both audio and animation, and also do not need to learn a programming language, which is very friendly to beginners. But the disadvantage is that there is no way to do all the things you want to do with one software, for example, if you want to add some interactive content, you still have to rely on the code to support.

In general speaking, I think we will choose a GPL when building performance-critical software like game engines or databases. Also in fields of developing large, maintainable systems with teams. But we will choose a scripting language when the software needs back-ups such as codes. If we wanna do a quick prototype, scripting language would be faster then a GPL.
