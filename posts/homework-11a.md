# This is a plan for my AT 3

As for the domain of the community I have chosen, it's about music. Because I have joined a music community and we will discuss how to produce beats or songs together and sometimes people will do collaboration in this community. As for the repertoire, we will gather together no matter online or offline and discuss about did something make a song or make a beat, people will give their opinions on it. As for the value, I think people would gain more knowledge compare to doing all the stuffs alone. And also people could meet some nice producer or singer would help them collaborate.

As for the code, I plan to use Three.js for the 3D visual graphic. Also Web Audio API for audio context analysis & HTML5 Audio for playback. The code uses event-driven programming for keyboard/mouse interaction, functional programming modes with array methods for data handling, and state management for recording/looping modes.

What I made is an interactive browser-based music creation tool that lets users play instruments with their keyboard, record performances, and see stunning 3D visualizations that react to the music in real-time. As for users how to interact with, users press A-L keys to play notes and press Z-M keys to trigger drum sounds. Then for recording and looping, click the 3D sphere to start recording, play any combination of piano and drums while recording, click sphere again to stop recording and automatically start looping. Click once more to stop the loop.

# Rewrite the text I wrote in task 4 as a haiku.

Musicians gather
Sharing beats, dreams intertwined—
Knowledge blooms as one

Producers and singers
Meet online, offline as friends—
Collaboration flows

No more solitude
Creative minds spark together—
Art multiplies truth

Three.js sphere spins
Web Audio breathes with each note—
Code and music dance

HTML5 Audio
Custom MP3 files replace—
Tone.js falls away

Event-driven beats
Keyboard strokes become music—
Functions orchestrate

State management flows
Recording loops through the sphere—
Memory holds rhythm

Keys pressed, sounds flow
A-L sings, Z-M drums beat—
Sphere records all dreams

Piano keys sustain
Hold down for melody's breath—
Drums snap rhythm tight

Click sphere, start record
Piano drums blend in real-time—
Loop your heart's rhythm

Timing compressed smart
Gaps shrink between audio clips—
Tighter beats emerge

Colors paint the screen
3D sphere pulses with life—
Music becomes light

Wireframe deforms wild
Each note bends reality—
Sixty frames per second

Rectangles fly past
Note timing painted in hue—
Visual feedback soars

Raycasting magic
Mouse clicks find the 3D sphere—
Interface transcends

Browser-based creation
No software downloads needed—
Music flows instant

Performance and art
Real-time visualization—
Two worlds become one

Custom audio files
Your drums, your notes, your vision—
Personal sound lives

Recording intelligence
Algorithm reads your intent—
Technology serves music

Producers unite
Browser-based beats bring us close—
Art shared, souls connected

Community grows strong
Knowledge shared makes all rise high—
Isolation ends

Music meets the web
Three dimensions hold our songs—
Digital stage opens

Click, play, record, loop—
Simple gestures birth complex art—
Simplicity's power

From code to community
Pixels dance with piano keys—
Human hearts connect

Technology serves
The ancient art of music—
Innovation bows

In the spinning sphere
Lives the future of creation—
Art and code as one

The whole editing process was pretty smooth, and the video is complete with friends playing my instruments. The part that was a bit painful was the haiku part, I had to get AI to generate a few versions of it, but there were some hard to pronounce rare characters, so there was no way to avoid it.
