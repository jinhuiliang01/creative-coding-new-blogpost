# Why Creative Coding Needs Inclusion as Infrastructure

Creative coding promises to democratise art and technology, turning code into a medium for creative expression. But behind this promise lies a fundamental question: should inclusivity be seen as a ‘nice to have’ feature, or as a core structural pillar that shapes how we build creative coding communities and tools?

The answer is important because creative coding is not neutral. Every line of code, every platform, every educational pathway includes choices about who gets to participate and whose voice gets heard.

## Language Barrier Issues

Consider this: most programming languages are written entirely in English, and Python's ‘if’ statements, JavaScript's ‘function’ declarations, and even visualisation tools assume you know English. This creates an immediate barrier for billions of potential creators around the world. While projects like China's modifications to Scratch show that alternatives are possible, they remain the exception. When the grammar of creativity requires fluency in English, we've excluded a huge number of people before they write their first line of code.

This language extends the gateway from grammar to documentation, tutorials, and community discussions, creating complex barriers for non-English speakers who might otherwise contribute innovative ideas to creative coding.

## Education and Digital Surveillance

Traditional computer science education, dominated by wealthy organisations, has a narrow definition of ‘legitimate’ technical knowledge. At the same time, the platforms on which creative programmers share their work - instagram, GitHub, and tiktok - act as surveillance systems, collecting intimate data about users' creative processes and social relationships while monetising creative labour. Monetisation.

This creates a double bind: creators need these platforms for visibility and community, but using them means being subject to algorithmic control and data extraction. The issue of surveillance is not just about government monitoring; it's also about how enterprise platforms can turn creative expression into raw material for predictive and control systems.

## Network effects and lock-in

The network effect makes dominant platforms more valuable as more people join them, creating a ‘switching cost’ that puts creators in a difficult position. An artist with thousands of Instagram followers cannot easily switch to other options without losing their audience, even if Instagram's algorithms work against their interests. The lack of interoperability between platforms reinforces existing monopolies and limits creative freedom.

## Building alternative infrastructure

The most promising developments are happening in extra-institutional centres - community makerspaces, online collectives and grassroots organisations operating outside of traditional academic and corporate structures. Places like the Poetic Computing School create spaces for technological learning while critically reflecting on the social impact of technology.

These spaces experiment with different approaches: multilingual tools, privacy-by-design systems, collaborative ownership models, and pedagogical approaches that do not replicate traditional gatekeepers. They bring together marginalised voices, challenge dominant assumptions about technology, and embody the principles of post-critical humanism.

## The Way Forward

Making inclusivity a structural pillar of creative coding requires rethinking everything: programming languages designed for multilingual use, platforms that prioritise user control over surveillance, educational pathways that bypass institutional gatekeepers, and economic models that do not rely on data extraction.

This is not about adding diversity to existing systems, but about building radically different systems. In a world facing a climate crisis and the rise of authoritarianism, we need as much creative and technical talent as possible. Building inclusive infrastructure is not only morally right, but also strategically vital, as we need to create the tools and communities needed to meet the challenges of the future.

The question is not whether we can afford to put inclusion at the heart of creative coding. Rather, it is whether we can afford it.
